Very simple example on how to:

1. create a sub account using Near api js

2. store the new account's keys in your .near-credentials folder

3. send near (alluding to other near account actions) to a desired account signing with the keys you just stored

Simply run the following to install the dependancies

```bash
    npm i
```

Then run

```bash
node createAccountAndSendNear.js
```
